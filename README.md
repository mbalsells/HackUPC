# HackUPC

## Introduction

This is the repository of our HackUPC 2019 Project called *Grasp: an education solution*.

## Project Organization

The project has two main parts: the API and the web implementation. 
For the API, we have created six HTTP endpoints, namely:

1. Login
2. Register
3. InfoUser: responds questions with information about the user.
4. Schedule: returns the weekly schedule of the user.
5. SetFeedback: informs the database that the user has sent a vote for a class.
6. Average: returs the personal and global averages of the score of a subject.

By default the backend runs in the local port 8080 and the front end runs in 4200.
